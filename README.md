# Fusion-QtWebApp

My internship project for the summer of 2018.

## Description

This is a current version of the Software Engineering internship project I have been given to complete over the summer. 

The task is essentially to create an embedded webserver/web-application, that is to communicate with a separate, locally-hosted server over TCP/IP, utilising a company-written API to request specific datasets. The entire application is then to use this data to produce dynamic HTML5 webpages to be delivered to a client, with real-time data being transmitted via a websocket from the webserver to the browser. Whether the HTML5 webpage is generated more on the server-side, or more on the client-side, is yet to be decided.

The project is written primarily in C++ within the Qt Framework, alongside HTML and Javascript, with data possibly being temporarily stored in the widely-used JSON format. 


The QtWebApp library has been used within this project, developed by [Stefan Frings](http://stefanfrings.de/qtwebapp/index-en.html), in accordance with the LGPL license attached.
